# Smart-Eye
It's a software that detects faces by identifying facial features in a photo or video using mechine learning algorithms. It first looks for an eye, and from there it identifies other facial features. it then compares these features to training data to confirm it has detected a face.. 
Face detection algorithms typically start by searching for human eyes, one of the easiest features to detect. They then try to detect facial landmarks, such as eyebrows, mouth, nose, nostrils and irises. Once the algorithm concludes that it has found a facial region, it does additional tests to confirm that it has detected a face.
